# form-spa

This is an spa for cpu utilization calculation. 

No framework is used because an spa is basically an application that rewrites data without needing a refresh.

Using pusher achieves the purpose of rewriting data, also there is an updateData method that updates the UI without needing

a refresh.

Index.php was used to serve as a server so I could push to heroku
